// Package ns implements NoxScript 3 originally used in Nox maps.
//
// Names of functions are synchronized with the latest NoxScript implementation:
// https://noxtools.github.io/noxscript/. Thus, most functions are drop-in replacements.
//
// Package provides additional type safety by using named types, booleans, etc.
// It does not expose object-oriented APIs which are typical to Go.
//
// See NS4 for object-oriented API: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/noxworld-dev/noxscript/ns/v4.
